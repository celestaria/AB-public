<h2 id=intro>
Introduction</h2>

	A lot of uncommon terminology is in use within W3C.
	Moreover, many seemingly ordinary words
	are given specialized meaning.
	Most of the time, such terms are given a definition some W3C document,
	but discovering where this definition lies may be challenging.

	This document provides an index of many such terms,
	starting with those defined in central documents
	like the [[w3c-process inline]] and [[w3c-patent-policy inline]],
	and continuing with a selection of noteworthy terms
	defined in other documents;
	finally, it provides a definition
	for terms commonly used but lacking a (known) formal definition in other documents.

	This document does not attempt to provide exhaustive coverage
	of all specialized technical terms in use in every W3C specification.
	Many are only in use within very limited contexts,
	and an exhaustive list would become too long to be practically usable.
	The focus here is on terms that may reasonably be encountered
	in many or most W3C groups.

	Nevertheless, <a href="#also">The last section of this document</a>
	links to more specialized glossaries maintained by other groups,
	as well as to earlier attempts at W3C-wide glossaries.
